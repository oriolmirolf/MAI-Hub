# Contributing to MAI-Hub

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this repository! 🚀

The goal of **MAI-Hub** is to collect "things past students did" to make life easier for future generations of the Master's in Artificial Intelligence. Whether you want to add better notes, share a lab solution from a previous year, or fix a broken link, your help is welcome.

## ⚠️ Academic Integrity & Disclaimer

**Please Read Carefully:**
* **This is a study guide, not a cheating tool.**
* **Do not** upload solutions to *currently active* assignments or exams. This violates the university's plagiarism policy and can get current students in trouble.
* Only upload content that belongs to you or is open source.
* By contributing, you certify that you have the right to share the content.

## 📂 How to Organise Your Contributions

To keep the repository clean, please follow the existing structure:

### 1. Identify the Category
Check if the subject is **Compulsory** or **Elective**.
* **`/Compulsory`**: (CI, CV, IHLT, IMAS, IML, PAR)
* **`/Elective`**: (e.g., DL, MASD, URL, NDVW...)

### 2. Folder Naming
* If the course folder already exists (e.g., `Elective/DL`), add your files inside.
* If the course folder is missing, please create it using the **official course acronym** (e.g., `AIHC`, `ATCI`).

## 🔄 The Workflow

1.  **Fork** this repository.
2.  Create a new **branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b add-dl-notes`).
3.  **Add your files.**
4.  **Commit** your changes with a clear message (`git commit -m "Add my repo for Deep Learning 2026"`).
5.  **Push** to your branch (`git push origin add-dl-notes`).
6.  Open a **Pull Request (PR)** against the `main` branch.

## 📝 File Formats
* **Markdown (.md)** is preferred for text/notes so they can be read directly on GitHub.
* **PDFs** are great for handwritten notes or cheat sheets.
* **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)** are great for lab stuff.
